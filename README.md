# extracing-image-data-from-.xls
Python script I wrote to extract the quantative data from an image in a .xls file that is generated by a bespoke camera system.

An instrument that I use at work produces an excel file for each measurement it takes. One of the outputs in each file is a heatmap of the image taking by the camera and the corresponding values that are being measured. However, I wanted to analyse more quantative data, namely the measured values along the centreline of each image. The images took the form of a trapezoidal heatmap surrounded by a black border with a second image in the sheet with the colourbar for the heatmap. 

Therefore I wrote a python script to extract and save the images from each .xls file, to extract the quantatised data from the colourbar to use to set the values in the image, set the value for each pixel using this scale and then extract the values for the centreline. This also required me to find the 'centre' of the image since due to the images being captued by physical measurement the centreline of the image is not neccessarily at the middle pixel of the image.
    
Due to confidentiality all of the variables have had to be anonymised .
